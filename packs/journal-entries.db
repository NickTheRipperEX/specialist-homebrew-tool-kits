Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency.</p><p>Adventuring is a hard life. With a cook along on the journey, your meals will be much better than the typical mix of hardtack and dried fruit.</p><hr /><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>As with all crafts, cooking requires the proper materials to create a meal.</p><h4><strong>Main Dish</strong></h4><p>In general, the primary food of a meal fits into one of several groups: @UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.zeLgRiSGbUwhFTHg]{Fish}, @UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.rncZYDIcfcKekf8X]{Fruit}, @UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.LY8jdL1v7kIXkN5t]{Grain}, @UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.BYzQSJjKxXQIs8NP]{Meat}, @UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.Y8hQfutmsVSnkaFU]{Pastry}, @UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.nezQ4cMnr7i0xBLP]{Poultry} or @UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.oyjKTp4sjqrfrFTr]{Vegetable}. Based upon the food group it falls into, the meal will have particular effects and have a different base cooking DC, as presented in the Main Dish table.</p><p>If an item in the Ingredients table fits into one of these categories, it can be used as the primary ingredient of the meal. If it normally has an additional effect or alters the creation of the meal in some way, it does not do so when used as the primary ingredient.</p><h4><strong>Additive Ingredients</strong></h4><p>Any other ingredients included in the creation of a meal, such as additional foods or spices, may potentially alter or add to the effects of the meal. The Ingredients table presents possible ingredients to add to a meal, providing a description of each one's effects, the DC modifier for the cooking check (if any), the type of food group it falls into (if any) for the purposes of serving as the main ingredient, and the typical market price per pound of each ingredient. Unless otherwise noted, using the same ingredient as an additive more than once has no additional effect.</p><h4><strong>Foraging for Ingredients</strong></h4><p>Many ingredients might be found out adventuring in the wilds. However, some are native to particular areas, hard to come by, or need to be manufactured in advance. As such, the most surefire way to acquire ingredients to use for meals is to buy them in bulk from civilized lands.</p><p>For those that are braving the wilderness and wish to acquire ingredients, they can attempt to forage or hunt for them. Foraging or hunting for ingredients requires at least one hour of work in a dedicated area, which can be done as part of a short or long rest, followed by either an Intelligence (Nature) check for foraging or a Wisdom (Survival) check for hunting, adding your proficiency in cook's utensils to the check if you are not proficient with the relevant skill. The DC of the check and the amount recovered is based upon the abundance of flora and fauna in the area, as determined by the DM.</p><p>On a success, you manage to recover ingredients, the type of which is determined by the DM. On a failure, you do not manage to scrounge up anything significant or edible, If you roll a 20 on the d20 for your check, you automatically succeed and also recover one ingredient of your choice from the Ingredients table, in addition to any others determined by the DM. If the ingredient you choose is not normally found out in the wild, you miraculously happen upon a stash of supplies left by someone else that contains it.</p><h5>Foraging/Hunting Check</h5><table><thead><tr><th id=\"food_and_water_availability\" style=\"text-align:center\">Food and Water Availability</th><th id=\"dc\" style=\"text-align:center\">DC</th><th id=\"ingredient_amount\" style=\"text-align:center\">Ingredient Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Abundant food and water sources</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>10</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 2d4[lbs]#Foraging for food (abundant)]]</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Limited food and water sources</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>15</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 1d6[lbs]#Foraging for food (limited)]]</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Very little, if any, food and water sources</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>20</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 1d4[lbs]#Foraging for food (very little)]]</td></tr></tbody></table><hr /><h3>Creating a Meal</h3><p>Once you have the ingredients, you can use them to begin preparing a meal. Creating a meal requires an hour of work, followed by an Intelligence or Wisdom check using your cook's utensils proficiency, with a cooking DC established by the type of meal and added ingredients. Each meal requires a number of pounds of food serving as the main dish equal to the number of creatures eating it. You can also mix in up to a number of additive ingredients equal to your proficiency bonus, requiring a half of a pound of each one per instance used.</p><p>Any meal that has a total crafting DC less than or equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (using the ability score you use to create the meal) may be crafted anywhere. Otherwise, cooking the meal is too complex to do on-the-go and must be done in a more properly established kitchen environment, such as one at a home or inn.</p><p>On a successful cooking check, you skillfully cook a delicious meal. On a failure, you manage to cook a filling meal using all of the ingredients, but it does not provide any benefits beyond sustenance for a single day. If you roll a 20 on the d20 for your check, you automatically succeed and end up creating a gourmet meal instead. A gourmet meal takes half as much time to consume and its effects when consumed instead last for a number of Long Rests equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><p>A meal remains fresh for 24 hours. Consuming it later than that will still provide sustenance, provided it has not passed its expiration (as determined by the DM), but will not provide any of its other effects.</p><hr /><h3>Consuming a meal</h3><p>The consumption of a meal can be conducted safely over the course of one hour, or as part of a short or long rest. This period includes the time spent serving the food to everyone, eating and carousing, and finally cleaning the mess afterwards. Once consumed, the meal provides each creature who participated certain benefits based upon the ingredients used until the next Long Rest. Regardless of the type of meal, consuming it restores 2d6 hit points. This restoration increases by 1d6 when the chef reaches 5th, 9th, 13th and 17th level.</p><p>If you consume a meal prepared using these rules while still under the effects of another, you lose the benefits of the previous meal.</p><p>A meal may be eaten faster than one hour, and each creature can declare how quickly they wish to attempt consuming it. Any creature that does so must make a Constitution saving throw, the DC and result of which is determined by the Speed Eating table. A creature that passes the Fulfilling DC gets the full benefits of the meal, and a creature that passes the Stomaching DC only receives the benefits of consuming the main ingredient and ends up taking the full hour to complete the meal. A creature that passes neither DC receives no benefits from the meal, takes the full hour to complete it, and suffers the effects of being Poisoned until they successfully complete a short rest following its conclusion as they recover from bad digestion.</p><h5>Speed Eating</h5><table><thead><tr><th id=\"time\" style=\"text-align:center\">Time</th><th id=\"fulfilling_dc\" style=\"text-align:center\">Fulfilling DC</th><th id=\"stomaching_dc\" style=\"text-align:center\">Stomaching DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">45 minutes or less</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>10</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>8</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">30 minutes or less</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>15</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>12</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">15 minutes or less</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>20</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>16</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">5 minutes or less</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>25</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>20</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><hr /><hr /><hr /><p></p><h2>Main Dish Table</h2><table><thead><tr><th id=\"food_type\" style=\"text-align:center\">Food type</th><th id=\"effects\" style=\"text-align:center\">Effects</th><th id=\"base_cooking_dc\" style=\"text-align:center\">Base Cooking DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.specialist-homebrew-tool-kits.specialist-homebrew-items.zeLgRiSGbUwhFTHg]{Fish}</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Choose one of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma.

The container may be opened as an action to release the poison into a 5 foot radius sphere, or thrown up to 20 feet to break it open as part of an Attack action. Each creature in the area when the poison is released or when they end their turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned and suffer the poison's effects. The poison remains effective for 1 minute, or until dispersed by a strong gust of air. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p></li><li><p><strong>Injury.</strong> One vial of injury poison may be applied as an Action to a single melee weapon, or you can use an action to dip up to 5 pieces of ammunition in it. A creature hit by poisoned weapons or ammunition must make a Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned and suffer the poison's effects. The poison remains effective for 1 minute after being exposed to the air when used, or until you apply another poison to the weapon or ammunition again.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Additive Ingredients</strong></p><p>In addition to a catalyst, the effects of a poison can be influenced by adding other ingredients. On their own, non-catalyzing ingredients have little to no effect. Combined with a catalyst, they can attain deadly potency.</p><p>When making a poison, you can include up to a number of additional ingredients equal to your Proficiency Bonus. However, some ingredients may have additional requirements, diminishing returns, or conflict with the use of other ingredients.</p><h4><strong>Foraging Ingredients</strong></h4><p>All sorts of flora can be found out in the wilderness, and with the right skills you can find what you need to slay your foes while traveling. If you can't get what you're looking for at an apothecary or the black market, foraging is your next best option.</p><p>Make an Intelligence or Wisdom check (your choice), adding either your proficiency in the Nature skill or Poisoner's Kits to the check. The DC of the check is based on your method of searching and the abundance of resources in the area as per the table below. Each foraging attempt takes 1 hour, with the availability of ingredients in the area determined by the DM.</p><h5><strong>Foraging Check DC</strong></h5><table><thead><tr><th id=\"search_pace\">Search Pace</th><th id=\"scarce/no_flora\">Scarce/No Flora</th><th id=\"regular_flora\">Regular Flora</th><th id=\"abundant_flora\">Abundant Flora</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dedicated Search</strong></td><td>18/25</td><td>13/20</td><td>10/15</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Slow/Stealth</strong></td><td>20/30</td><td>15/25</td><td>13/18</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>25/-</td><td>18/30</td><td>15/20</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fast</strong></td><td>30/-</td><td>25/-</td><td>20/30</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you pass the first DC, you recover one random ingredient from the Normal Ingredients table. If you also manage to pass the second DC, you instead can choose to recover one random ingredient from the Special Ingredients table. If you fail to pass either DC, you find nothing.</p><p>If you roll a 20 on the d20 for your check, you automatically succeed and instead recover 1d4+1 random ingredients from either table instead (your choice for each ingredient), provided it is possible to find ingredients of the desired type based on the current conditions. You cannot, for example, choose to find Special Ingredients when traveling at a Fast Pace in an area with Regular Flora.</p><blockquote><h5>DM Note: Mass Foraging</h5><p>If you are running a campaign with a substantial amount of travel or downtime, consider the following approach to handling extensive time that your players could have spent foraging.</p><p>Instead of rolling every in-game hour, have your player roll once each day they would like to forage. For every two hours past the first that they spend foraging (declared before the roll), grant them one additional ingredient on a successful check.</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Poisons from Creatures</strong></h4><p>You can attempt to harvest poison from a venomous creature, such as a snake, that you encounter in the wilds. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 10 minutes followed by a DC 20 Nature (Intelligence) check to harvest ingredients from a dead creature for one vial's worth, or a DC 20 Animal Handling (Wisdom) check to harvest ingredients from an incapacitated creature for half a vial's worth. If you fail this check, you are unable to extract any poison. You can only attempt to harvest ingredients from a dead creature once, or from a living creature once per day. Success or failure, attempting to extract poison from a living creature removes their ability to make use of their own poison for 24 hours.</p><p>To turn these ingredients into usable poison, you must succeed on a crafting check (detailed in \"Creating a Poison\" below) with effects and a DC determined by the DM at the time of crafting (minimum crafting DC 13). Ingredients harvested from poisonous creatures typically cannot be combined with foraged ingredients other than a catalyst.</p><hr /><h3>Creating a Poison</h3><p>Once you recover an ingredient, you can begin the process of crafting a poison. Crafting a poison requires an hour of work, followed by an Intelligence or Wisdom check using your poisoner's kit proficiency, with a crafting DC based upon the ingredients used.</p><p>Poisons require one catalyst as a base, and can include up to a number of additional ingredients equal to your Proficiency Bonus. The catalyst used determines the base crafting and save DC, and you cannot use more than one catalyst at once when crafting a poison. You can, however, add more instances of additional ingredients up to your ingredient limit, enhancing the effects or altering each DC accordingly.</p><p>Any poison with a total crafting DC less than or equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (using the ability score you use to craft the poison) may be crafted anywhere, provided you have the tools and ingredients to do so. Otherwise, crafting the poison must be done in a safe and stable environment, such as a room at an inn.</p><p>On a successful crafting check, you create one vial of poison, the type of which is based on the catalyst used to create it. On a failure, you do not create the poison and all the ingredients used are lost. If you roll a 20 on the d20 for your check, you are able to stretch the ingredients and make 2 vials. Vials remain stable for 2 weeks after crafting before becoming inert.</p><blockquote><h5>Variant: Drow Poison</h5><p>A Drow Elf that has proficiency with Poisoner's Kits may craft drow poison by imbuing a catalyst with their innate magical abilities and a small amount of their blood.</p><p>Choose one of the spells granted to you by your Drow Magic trait to imbue into the poison, substituting it for one ingredient other than the catalyst. You lose the ability to cast or imbue it using the trait until you complete a long rest. However, your magic mixes with the catalyst to increase the Save DC of the poison by +1 for each spell imbued. Additionally, based on the spell(s) you chose, the poison takes on an additional benefit(s), as listed below:</p><ul><li><strong>Dancing Lights.</strong> The Crafting DC of the poison is reduced by 1.</li><li><strong>Faerie Fire.</strong> The duration of the poison is increased by one step: from 1 round to 1 minute, 1 minute to 1 hour, 1 hour to 8 hours, or 8 hours to 24 hours.</li><li><strong>Darkness.</strong> If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while Poisoned and does not repeat the saving throw until they wake up. The creature wakes up early if it takes damage from a source other than the poison, or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</li></ul></blockquote><hr /><hr /><hr /><h2>Normal Ingredients Table</h2><table><thead><tr><th id=\"d20\" style=\"text-align:center\">d20</th><th id=\"name\" style=\"text-align:center\">Name</th><th id=\"type\" style=\"text-align:center\">Type</th><th id=\"craft_dc\" style=\"text-align:center\">Craft DC</th><th id=\"effects\" style=\"text-align:center\">Effects</th><th id=\"save_dc\" style=\"text-align:center\">Save DC</th><th id=\"market_price\" style=\"text-align:center\">Market Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">1-4</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Black Lotus</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Catalyst (Injury)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Target is Poisoned for 1 minute (save at end of turn to stop)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10 gp</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">5-6</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Rot Breath</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Catalyst (Inhaled)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">12</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Target is Poisoned for 1 round</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">20 gp</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">7</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Ravenbane</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Catalyst (Ingested)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Target is Poisoned for 1 hour</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">13</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">15 gp</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Graveroot</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Ingredient</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">─</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">─</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">5 gp</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">9</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Boistureberry</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Ingredient</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">The target takes the full damage dealt by the poison regardless of the result of the saving throw.</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">-2</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10 gp</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Nighthollow Berries</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Ingredient</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">-2</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">─</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">─</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">5 gp</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">11-12</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Peil Lichen</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Ingredient</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">+1</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Target takes 2d6 poison damage upon a failed save.
