# Specialist-Homebrew-Tool-Kits

A tools supplement for D&D 5th edition, for use within Foundry VTT. 

Everything you need to craft while on-the-go. Proficiency not included.

This compendium module is a compilation of all my Tool Proficiency supplements for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. Each one gives options for characters to explicitly use a different tool kit for mechanical benefits during their adventures. Each supplement also includes a list of add-on/example items to accompany them.

## Contents

Currently, I have supplements for the following tool kits:

- **Cook's Utensils:** Create delicious meals and confections that will help bolster the morale of your party. Comes with a multitude of ingredients that provide a variety of buffs based on their respective food groups and how you prepare them.
- **Leatherworker's Tools:** Bundled into "Masterwork Equipment and Materials", you can make, maintain and improve weapon and armor items made of hide or other leather-like materials.
- **Poisoner's Kit:** Hunt down and slay your foes with a variety of toxic concoctions. Comes with many catalysts and additive ingredients that you can use to tailor poisons to your taste.
- **Smith's Tools:** Bundled into "Masterwork Equipment and Materials", you can make, maintain and improve weapon and armor items made of metallic materials.
- **Weaver's Tools:** Bundled into "Masterwork Equipment and Materials", you can make, maintain and improve weapon and armor items made of cloth or other fiberous materials.
- **Woodcarver's Tools:** Bundled into "Masterwork Equipment and Materials", you can make, maintain and improve weapon and armor items made of wood or other plant-like materials.

However, as of the current version not all tool kits are implemented within the module. Details about the status of each tool kit can be found below.

### Released

The following tool kits are included with the latest release:

- **Cook's Utensils**

### Currently Implementing

The following tool kits are undergoing active implementation in Foundry VTT and included in the repository, but not in the latest release:

- **Poisoner's Kit**


### Under Development

The following tool kits are not included in the repository or latest release, but undergoing active development or playtesting within my own games:

- **Leatherworker's Tools:**
- **Smith's Tools**
- **Weaver's Tools**
- **Woodcarver's Tools**

### Not Implemented

The following tools have not been given implementation at all, but I have a general idea for how to implement them and plan to do so in the future:

- **Alchemist's Supplies:** Acids, explosives, topical damaging implements. Burn baby, burn.
- **Brewer's Supplies:** May implement something similar to Cook's Utensils, or bundle them together under the umbrella of food and drink creation.
- **Gaming Sets:** Create a series of macros that will simulate a simple table-top game between two or more players.
- **Herbalism Kit:** Create potions and lotions galore to aid you in your adventures. May also allow the infusion of spell-effects for spellcasters.
- **Musical Instruments:** Provide mechanical benefits to the use of instruments, such as minorly inspiring allies or distract enemies. Bards will receive additional benefits to using their own Bardic Inspiration when using this supplement.
- **Tinker's Tools:** Create tiny trinkets and devices to help you solve a multitude of problems.

### No Plans

The following tools have not yet been considered for implementation, but I may get around to thinking about their implementation in the future at my discretion:

- **Caligrapher's Supplies**
- **Disguise Kit**
- **Forgery Kit**


### Will Not Implement

The following proficiencies I have considered and have no intention of attempting creation of a supplement for them until further notice:

- **Carpenter's Tools:** I mean, if you want to build houses, then they can be useful. But there isn't much that could be reasonable provided for incidental mechanical benefits, it would be all fluff.
- **Cartographer's Tools:** This requires much more work regarding open-world exploration elements. Fluff.
- **Cobbler's Tools:** Shoes? This is a game that revolves around fighting evil, not being a merchant.
- **Glassblower's Tools:** Creating art pieces to, at-most, sell for gold. The point of the game is to adventure and fight monsters or villains.
- **Navigator's Tools:** This requires much more work regarding open-world exploration elements. Also fluff.
- **Painter's Supplies:** Creating art pieces to, at-most, sell for gold. The point of the game is to adventure and fight monsters or villains.
- **Potter's Tools:** Creating art pieces to, at-most, sell for gold. The point of the game is to adventure and fight monsters or villains.
- **Thieves' Tools:** They realistically only have use in picking locks and disabling traps, and that is just a very straightforward ability check against a given DC.
- **Vehicles:** Will require their own supplemental implementation of many elements, far beyond the scope of just this module.
